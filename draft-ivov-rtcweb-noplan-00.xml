      <t>
        This document a model for lightweight use of SDP Offer/Answer in
        WebRTC. The goal is to minimize the number of Offer/Answer
        exchanges in a WebRTC session and leave to applications the
        freedom to implement the signalling that they may need in a way
        that best fits their requirements and topologies. This includes
        signalling multiple media sources or providing identification in
        multi-party sessions.

      <t>
        In its early stages the RTCWEB working group chose to use the
        Session Description Protocol (SDP) and the Offer/Answer model
        <xref target="RFC3264"/> when establishing and
        negotiating sessions. This choice was also accompanied by the
        decision not to mandate a specific signalling protocol so that,
        once interoperability has been achieved, web applications can
        choose the semantics that best fit their requirements. In some
        scenarios however, such as those involving the use of multiple
        media sources, these choices have left open the issue of exactly
        which operations should be handled by SDP Offer/Answer and which
        of them should be left to application-specific signalling.
      </t>
      <t>
        At the time of writing of this document, the RTCWEB working
        group is considering two approaches to addressing the issue,
        that are often referred to as Plan A
        <xref target="PlanA"/> and Plan B
        <xref target="PlanB"/>.
