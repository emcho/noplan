Abstract

   This document a model for lightweight use of SDP Offer/Answer in
   WebRTC.  The goal is to minimize reliance on Offer/Answer exchanges
   in a WebRTC session and provide applications with the tools necessary
   to implement the signalling that they may need in a way that best
   fits their requirements and topologies.  This simplifies signalling
   of multiple media sources or providing RTP Synchronisation source
   (SSRC) identification in multi-party sessions.  Another important
   goal of this model is to remove from clients topological constraints
   such as the requirement to know all SSRC identifiers that they could
   potentially introduce in a particular session and the need to
   announce them prior to actually sending them.

   This document does not question the use of SDP and the Offer/Answer
   model or the value they have in terms of interoperability with legacy
   or other non-WebRTC devices.

1.  Background

   In its early stages the RTCWEB working group chose to use the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) and the Offer/Answer model [RFC3264] when
   establishing and negotiating sessions.  This choice was also
   accompanied by the decision not to mandate a specific signalling
   protocol so that, once interoperability has been achieved, web
   applications can choose the semantics that best fit their
   requirements.  In some scenarios however, such as those involving the
   use of multiple media sources, these choices have left open the issue
   of exactly which operations should be handled by SDP Offer/Answer and
   which of them should be left to application-specific signalling.

   At the time of writing of this document, the RTCWEB working group is
   considering two approaches to addressing the issue, that are often
   referred to as Plan A [PlanA] and Plan B [PlanB].  Both of them

   describe semantics that require Offer/Answer exchanges in a number of
   situations where this could be avoided, particularly when adding or
   removing a media source to a session.  This requirement applies
   equally to cases where a client adds the stream of a newly activated
   web cam, a simulcast flow or upon the arrival or departure of a
   conference participant.

   Plan A handles such notifications with the addition or removal of
   independent m= lines [PlanA], while Plan B relies on the use of
   multiplexed m= lines but still depends on the Offer/Answer exchanges
   for the addition or removal of media stream identifiers [MSID].

   By taking the Offer/Aanswer approach, both Plan A and Plan B take
   away from the application the opportunity to handle such events in
   away that is most fitting for the use case, which, among other
   things, also goes against the working group's decision to not to
   define a specific signalling protocol.  (It could be argued that it
   is therefore only natural how proponents of each plan, having
   different use cases in mind, are remarkably far from reaching
   consensus).

   Another problem, more specific to Plan B, is the reliance on
   preliminary announcement of SSRC identifiers for stream
   identification.  Why this could be perceived as relatively
   straightforward in one-to-one sessions or even conference calls
   within controlled environments, it can be a problem in the following
   cases:

   o  interoperability with legacy/non-WebRTC endpoints

   o  use within non-controlled and potentially federated conference
      environments where new RTP streams may appear relatively often.
      In such cases the signalling required to describe all of them
      through Offer/Answer may represent substantial overhead while none
      or only a part of it (e.g.  the description of a main, active
      speaker stream) may be required by the application.

   By increasing the number of Offer/Answer exchanges Both Plan A and
   Plan B also increase the risk of encountering glare situations (i.e.
   cases where both parties in a session attempt to change the session
   at the same time).  While glare is possible with basic Offer/Answer
   and resolution of such situations must be implemented anyway, the
   need to frequently resort to such code may either negatively impact
   user experience (e.g.  when "back off" resolution is used) or require
   substantial modifications in the Offer/Answer model and/or further
   venturing into the land of signalling protocols
   [ROACH-GLARELESS-ADD].

Internet-Draft    No Plan: SDP O/A with Multiple SSRCs          May 2013


2.  Introduction

   The goal of this document is to provide directions for use of the SDP
   Offer/Answer model in a way that satisfies the following
   requirements:

   o  the addition and removal of alternative media sources (e.g.
      conference participants, multiple web cams or "slides" ) must be
      possible without the need of Offer/Answer exchanges

   o  call establishment must not require preliminary announcement or
      even knowledge knowledge of all potentially participating media
      sources.

   o  application specific signalling should be used to cover most
      semantics following call establishment, such as adding, removing
      or identifying SSRCs.

   o  straightforward interoperability with widely deployed legacy
      endpoints with rudimentary support for Offer/Answer.  This
      includes devices that allow for one audio and potentially one
      video m= line and that expect to only ever be required to render a
      single RTP stream at a time for any of them.  (Note that this does
      not include devices that expect to see multiple "m=video" lines
      for different SSRCs as they can hardly be viewed as "widely
      deployed legacy")

   To achieve the above requirements this specification expects that
   browsers and WebRTC endpoints in general will only use SDP Offer/
   Answer to establish transport channels and initialize an RTP stack
   and codec/processing chains.  This also includes any renegotiation
   that requires the re-initialisation of these chains.  For example,
   adding VP8 to a session that was setup with only H.264, would
   obviously still require an Offer/Answer exchange.

   All other session control and signalling are to be left to
   applications.  app-specific signalling: SDP, xmpp, rfc4575, clue

   The actual semantics presented here do not differ fundamentally from
   those proposed by Plan A and Plan B.  The main differentiation point
   of this approach is the fact that the exact protocol mechanism is
   left to WebRTC applications.  Such applications or lightweight
   signalling gateways can then implement either Plan A, or Plan B, or
   an entirely different signalling protocol, depending on what best
   matches their use cases and topology.

3.  Reliance on Offer/Answer

   The model presented in this specification relies on use of SDP and
   Offer/Answer in quite the same way as many of the pre-WebRTC (and
   most of the legacy) endpoints do: negotiating formats, establishing
   transport channels and exchanging, in a declarative way, media and
   transport parameters that are then used for the initialization of the
   corresponding stacks.

   The following is an example presenting what this specification views
   as a typical offer sent by a WebRTC endpoint:

   o=- 0 0 IN IP4 198.51.100.33
   s=
   t=0 0

   a=group:BUNDLE audio video                // declaring BUNDLE Support

   a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000
   a=rtpmap:8 PCMA/8000

   a=extmap:1 urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:csrc-audio-level  //5825 header

   a=rtpmap:98 H264/90000
   a=imageattr:98 send [x=[0-1280],y=[0-720]] recv [x=[0-1920],y=[0-1200]]

   The answer to the offer above would have roughly the same structure.
   The most important aspects here are:

   o  Preserves interoperability with most kinds of legacy or non-WebRTC
      endpoints.

   o  Allow the negotiation of most parameters that concern the media/
      RTP stack (typically the browser)

   o  Only a single Offer/Answer exchange is required for session
      establishment

   o  Leave complete freedom to applications as to the way that they are
      going to signal any other information such as SSRC identification
      information or the addition or removal of RTP streams.

3.1.  Interoperability with Legacy

   Interoperating with legacy endpoints was one of the main reasons for
   the RTCWEB working group to choose the SDP Offer/Answer model.  It is
   important to clarify the compatibility claims that this specification
   makes.

   A legacy/non-WebRTC endpoint is considered to have the following
   characteristics:

   o  Likely to use the SIP protocol.

   o  Capability to gracefully handle one audio and potentially one
      video m= line in an SDP Offer.

   o  Capability to render a maximum of one SSRC per m=line at any given
      moment but multiple, consecutive SSRCs over a period of time.
      This would be the case with transferred session replacements for
      example.

   o  Possibly have features such as ICE, BUNDLE, RTCP-MUX, etc.  Just
      as likely not to.

Internet-Draft    No Plan: SDP O/A with Multiple SSRCs          May 2013


   o  Exact set of features and capabilities: Guaranteed to be wildly
      and widely diverse.

   While it is relatively simple for RTCWEB to accommodate some of the
   above, it is obviously impossible to design a model that could simply
   be labeled "compatible with legacy".  It is reasonable to assume that
   use cases involving use of such endpoints will be designed for a
   relatively specific set of devices and applications.  The role of the
   WebRTC framework is to hence provide a least-common-denominator model
   that can then be extended by applications.

   It is just as important not to make choices or assumptions that will
   render interoperability for some applications or topologies difficult
   or even impossible.

   This is exactly what the use of Offer/Answer discussed here strives
   to achieve.  Audio/Video offers originating from WebRTC endpoints
   will always have a maximum of one audio and one video m= line.  It
   will be up to applications to determine exactly how many streams they
   can afford to send once such a session has been established.  The
   exact mechanism to do this is outside the scope of this document (or
   WebRTC in general).

   Note that it is still possible for WebRTC endpoints to indicate
   support for a maximum number of incoming or outgoing streams for
   reasons such as processing constraints.  Use of the "max-send-ssrc"
   and "max-recv-ssrc" attributes [max-ssrc] could be one way of doing
   this.  It is important however, not to rely on the presence of that
   indication in incoming descriptions as well as to provide
   applications with a way of retrieving such capabilities from the
   WebRTC stack (e.g.  the browser).

   Determining whether a peer has the ability to seamlessly switch from
   one SSRC to another is also left to application specific signalling.
   It is worth noting that protocols such as SIP for example, often
   accompany SSRC replacements with extra signalling (re-INVITEs with a
   "replaces" header) that can easily be reused by applications or
   mapped to something that they deem more convenient.

   For the sake of interoperability this specification strongly advises
   against the use of multiple m= lines per media type.  Not only would
   such use be meaningless to a large number of legacy endpoints but it
   is also likely to be mishandled by many of them and cause unexpected
   behaviour.
